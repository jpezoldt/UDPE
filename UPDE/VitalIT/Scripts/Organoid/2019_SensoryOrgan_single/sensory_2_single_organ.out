Processing Sample sensory_2_single_organ_S4  following DropSeq pipeline...
1. Fastq to SAM using Picard
2. Filtering
2.1. Tag Cells (12bp Barcode)
2.2. Tag Molecules (8bp UMI)
2.3. Filter Bad quality reads
2.4. Trim SMART adapter in 5' sequence of reads (at least 5bp)
2.5. Trim PolyA sequences in 3' sequence of reads (at least 6bp)
3. Revert back from BAM to Fastq file
4. Alignment
4.1. Mapping with STAR (unsorted)
Jan 09 16:55:24 ..... started STAR run
Jan 09 16:55:24 ..... loading genome
Jan 09 16:55:40 ..... started mapping
Jan 09 18:29:00 ..... finished successfully
4.2. Sorting by read name (required)
4.3. Add tags from unaligned BAM to the STAR-aligned BAM file
4.4. Add GE (Gene Exon) tags from the GTF file to the BAM file when read overlaps a gene exon
4.5. Detect and Correct Bead Synthesis Errors (NUM_BARCODES parameters should be roughly 2x expected number of cells)
5. Digital Gene Expression and final stats/cleaning
5.1. Generate Histogram of reads per cell barcodes (to select relevant cell number cutoff)
5.2. Adapt 'expectedCellNumber' variable if needed
Current value = 1000
5.2. Generate UMI Matrix (use at least one of MIN_NUM_GENES_PER_CELL, MIN_NUM_TRANSCRIPTS_PER_CELL, NUM_CORE_BARCODES or CELL_BC_FILE)
5.3. Clean intermediate files
5.4. Generate fastQC for fastq file and final BAM
